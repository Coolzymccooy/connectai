# Work Log - 2026-02-17

## Completed Today
- Stabilized app boot path and fixed runtime crash (`addNotification` initialization order).
- Reworked realtime degradation handling so failures are isolated per surface instead of global hard-disable.
- Added tenant normalization toward `default-tenant` and reduced tenant drift points.
- Improved settings load/save consistency and server settings metadata response.
- Added token refresh retry for Firestore permission-denied health ping path.
- Reduced noisy debug behavior and cleaned repeated notification key collisions.
- Restored team DM transport baseline (messages now deliver between team members).

## In Progress
- Remove duplicate DM writes/render events.
- Prevent repeated auto-intro bootstrap message insertion in existing conversations.
- Fix inbox-initiated internal call flow that currently does not reach target teammate.
